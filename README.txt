TIC TAC TOE CHALLENGE README
    This is a coding challenge that I completed for an interview process

SETUP
    Local setup will assume you're running MacOS X, Windows 10, or Ubuntu 20.04.
    I created the setup aimed at future contributions from myself, but this will
    setup the program for execution.  If planning on only running it, you could stop
    at the requirements installation.

LOCAL SETUP
    *   Ensure you have python 3.6 or above installed on your local system
    *   Clone this repo
            git clone https://gitlab.com/ivybrandyn_personal/tic_tac_toe_challenge.git
    *   Create a virtual environment
            python3 -m venv .env
    *   Activate the environment
            source .env/bin/activate
    *   Install all dependencies using pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt
    *   Install pre-commit hooks Black, Flake8, and iSort into your .git/directory
            pre-commit install

ISSUES
    *   None known to me at the moment.
